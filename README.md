# Random-Username
Creates a random username based off a given dataset. I know this code is awfully simple, I just thought I do a lot of random username generation for my operational security why not upload the code and have it there if needed. Plus, nobody has made any of system-local script for this kind of service. I hope it helps someone out there.
