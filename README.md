# Random-Username
Creates a random username based off a given dataset. I know this code is awfully simple, I just thought I do a lot of random username generation for my operational security why not upload the code and have it there if needed. Plus, nobody has made any kind of service that is offline for this kind of thing. I hope it helps someone out there.
